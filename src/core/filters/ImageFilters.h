/**
 * @file ImageFilters.h
 * @brief Image processing filters with Qt integration, progress tracking, and cancellation support.
 * 
 * This file contains the declaration of the ImageFilters class, which provides a comprehensive
 * set of image processing operations including basic filters (grayscale, invert), geometric
 * transformations (flip, rotate, resize), advanced effects (blur, edge detection, infrared),
 * and special filters (TV/CRT, purple tint). All filters support progress tracking and
 * cancellation for long-running operations.
 * 
 * @details The ImageFilters class is designed to work seamlessly with Qt's GUI framework,
 * providing real-time progress updates and the ability to cancel operations mid-execution.
 * It uses atomic operations for thread-safe cancellation and integrates with Qt's progress
 * bar and status bar components.
 * 
 * @features
 * - Progress tracking for all long-running operations
 * - Cancellation support using atomic flags
 * - Qt integration with progress bars and status updates
 * - Comprehensive error handling and exception safety
 * - Support for various image formats through the Image class
 * - Memory-efficient processing with in-place operations where possible

 * @class ImageFilters
 * @brief Comprehensive image processing class with Qt integration and cancellation support.
 * 
 * The ImageFilters class provides a complete suite of image processing operations designed
 * to work seamlessly with Qt applications. It supports progress tracking, cancellation,
 * and real-time status updates for all operations.
 * 
 * @details This class implements various image processing algorithms including:
 * - Basic color operations (grayscale, invert, black & white)
 * - Geometric transformations (flip, rotate, resize, crop)
 * - Advanced effects (blur, edge detection, infrared simulation)
 * - Special effects (TV/CRT simulation, purple tint, frame addition)
 * - Image combination (merge operations)
 * 
 * All long-running operations support cancellation and progress tracking through Qt's
 * progress bar and status bar components.
 * 
 * @note This class is designed to work with the Image class and requires Qt 6.8.1 or later.
 * @see Image class for image data structure and basic operations
 * @see QProgressBar for progress tracking
 * @see QStatusBar for status updates
